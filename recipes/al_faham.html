        <p>Alfahm is an Arabic grilled chicken. This chicken recipe is very popular in the middle east as it is marinated with Arabian spice and barbequed in a charcoal grill or in the oven.</p>
       
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large whole chicken</li>
            <li>1 tsp red chilli powder</li> 
            <li>½ tsp turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>
            <li>¾ cup yogurt</li>
            <li>½ tbsp ginger</li>
            <li>½ tbsp garlic</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        <h2>How to Make</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>MClean and wash Whole Chickens (2.2 lb). Cut it into two pieces lengthwise, or into four pieces. Using a fork or knife prick the chicken well so that the marination goes inside the chicken.</li>
            <li>Grind Onion (1), Fresh Ginger (1/2 in), Garlic (3 cloves), Green Chili Peppers (2), Tomato (1), Yogurt (1 Tbsp), the juice from Lemon (1), Ground Black Pepper (1/2 tsp), Arabic Masala (1/2 Tbsp), and Salt (to taste) into a fine paste</li>
            <li>Marinate the chicken with this paste and cover and keep in the fridge for 3-4 hours. It's good if you can leave it overnight.</li>  
            <li>Here it is grilled in an oven. For that preheat the oven at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place the chicken on the grill tray. You should place another tray below so that all the drippings get collected in it.</li> 
            <li>Grill for about 45 to 50 minutes turning sides in between and brush some olive oil each time.</li> 
            <li>Or grill it on a charcoal grill turning sides in between and brush some Olive Oil (1 Tbsp) each time.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with kuboos, chapathi or roti with some salad lemon wedges and any dip of your choice.</li>
