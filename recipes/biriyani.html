      <body>
        <p>Chicken Biryani or Murgh Biryani, is a classic Indian dish that has captured the hearts and taste buds of food lovers around the world. The recipe typically calls for a combination of aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and cinnamon, which are blended together to create a unique and flavourful spice blend. The chicken is marinated in this spice mix, which infuses the meat with its rich and complex flavours. The rice used in Biryani is equally important, with long-grain basmati rice being the preferred variety due to its light and fluffy texture that pairs perfectly with the spiced chicken</p>
        <p>To prepare chicken Biryani, the chicken is first cooked in a pot with a variety of aromatic ingredients such as onions, garlic, and ginger. Once the chicken is cooked through, it is layered on top of the rice in a large pot or Dutch oven, and the whole thing is baked in the oven or cooked on the stovetop until the rice is perfectly cooked and the flavors have melded together. The final result is a flavorful and aromatic dish that is sure to impress even the most discerning foodies.</p>
